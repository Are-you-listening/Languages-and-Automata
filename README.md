## Course Info

[Spring, 2023 | Talen en automaten, 1001WETTAL]

The goals off this project for this course consists of (but not limited to): Show expertise in languages and automata theory, Apply proper communication, Self-reflection, Developing an analytical mindset,

## Product Requirements

Creating a functional program by using a set of theoretical constructs (algoritms and automata).

## Final Product

The program has a midi file parser from which datat is extracted and automata are constructed. By applying different algorithms we can check for similarity in songs, group songs on genre (specified by user defined paramaters) It is also possible to convert an automaton into a song (midi file).
